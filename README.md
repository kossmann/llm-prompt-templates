# ðŸ¤– LLM Prompt Templates

This is my personal repository of Prompt Templates for Large Language Models (LLMs) that I use daily.

I primarily use these templates with [Simon Willison's `llm` CLI utility](https://github.com/simonw/llm). If you're curious about how to get started with it, I wrote a detailed guide on my blog: [Quick Guide to Using the `llm` CLI Utility](https://www.danielkossmann.com/quick-guide-using-llm-cli-utility-python-library-simon-willison/).

I plan to keep this repository up to date with new templates as I create them.

My hope is that sharing this collection will inspire others to build and share their own prompt templates for LLMs.

Feel free to explore, adapt, and contribute!

This template helps me write messages and learn from my mistakes, as I'm not a native English speaker. It provides corrections and suggestions to improve my English writing skills.
